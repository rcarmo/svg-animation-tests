This is a subset of the SVG animation tests for digital signage I developed for Codebits a few years ago using [Tumult Hype](http://tumult.com/hype/), and which I've found useful throughout the years to do performance testing for various devices.

You can see some of it in action in [this Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ruicarmo/albums/72157643937892615).
